  <h3 class = "underline">Fun facts about the Mona Lisa:</h3>
  <ul>
         <li> She has broken many hearts: When the painting was first put on public display, a string of "suitors bearing flowers, poems and impassioned notes arrived solely to gaze into her eyes.
         <li> The entire country of France mourned when she was stolen: The New York Times retroactively compared the public display of grief to that seen in the wake of Princess Diana's death in 1997. Thousands came to look at the blank wall in Louvre in shock where she once hung and left flowers, notes, and other remembrances.
         <li> Pablo Picasso was suspected to have stolen the Mona Lisa: He has been caught buying stolen Louvre pieces before, so he was brought in for questioning
